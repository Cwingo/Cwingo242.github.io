    <h1>Best Giraffes</h1>
    <h2>Cool Facts</h2>

    <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals in the world. Their long necks allow them to reach leaves high up in trees that other animals cannot. They are gentle herbivores and can run surprisingly fast when needed.</p>

    <p>Each giraffe has a unique coat pattern, much like a human fingerprint. They also use their long tongues, which can be up to 18 inches, to grab food from trees.</p>
