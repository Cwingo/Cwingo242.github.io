  <p>The title "king of the jungle" belongs to lions although they really live in grasslands together with savannas. The powerful hunting abilities of lions enable them to hunt together as they pursue their prey which includes zebras wildebeests and buffalo. The females of the pride perform most hunting duties but males defend both the pride members and their territory against competing males. The powerful roar of lions reaches distances of five miles while they represent strength and leadership and courage in various global cultures.</p>
  <p>People across the globe admire lions because of their courageous nature and powerful strength and natural leadership abilities which leads to their frequent appearance in stories and legends. In their natural habitat lions form prides where females hunt for food and males defend the territory which demonstrates the need for teamwork and balance. The loud roar of lions travels across many miles to alert potential threats and maintain unity within their pride. The characteristics of lions make them appear as brave symbols in fiction through characters such as Simba from The Lion King and Laval from LEGO Legends of Chima. The stories about lions as noble leaders in fiction base their portrayal on the actual qualities which make these animals powerful and respected in reality.
